El protector del agua que tenía un delito grave, se encuentra detenido sin derecho a fianza. Seis protectores adicionales de agua eligieron pasar el fin de semana en la cárcel y tendrán audiencias de fianza y de lectura de cargos el lunes. Por Brenda Norrell Censored News 15 de Oct., el año 2016 al día de hoy 8 p.m. Villanueva, S. (Traducción) ST. ANTHONY – Más de 500 protectores del agua se metieron a los sitios de construcción del oleoducto Acceso a Dakota de la petrolera y se encontraron con la fuerza masiva de la policía y vehículos blindados el sábado. Al menos 16 protectores del agua fueron detenidas, entre ellos una persona que se había encadenado durante cinco horas a los equipos de construcción. “Caminamos dos millas para apoyar a nuestro guerrero que está encadenado”, dijo una mujer, entre cientos caminando desde varias direcciones. Los protectores del agua reportaron haber visto a la Guardia Nacional que llegaba cerca del lugar donde el protector del agua estaba encadenado a una maquinaria de construcción. Joye dijo, “Se empezó por la mañana antes de que saliera el sol sobre el horizonte oriental, con oraciones en un círculo de protectores del agua y los defensores de la tierra. Esa es la mejor sensación del mundo. La mañana transcurrió con un helicóptero que volaba por encima, una fila de coches que se alargaba detrás y delante de nosotros. Cada persona dedicada a la protección de lo Sagrado.” “Las oraciones, el agua y el tabaco fueron ofrecidos a la policía para que oremos. La policía regreso a algunos y la gente caminaba sobre la colina para ofrecer sus oraciones.” Joye, que describe el dolor de las inyecciones médicas a sus rodillas, dijo: “Mis rodillas están sufriendo todavía de las inyecciones, por lo que regresó a ayudar a la retaguardia.” “La policía tiene coches en todos los caminos que conducen a dónde estamos y han bloqueado los que desean caminar para orar.” “Estamos a la espera de ver si podemos conseguir nuestros guerreros de la oración de vuelta sanos y salvos. En otra acción de aquí 10 fueron detenidos,” dijo Joye. “Los trabajadores de DAPL (el oleoducto Acceso a Dakota, por sus siglas en inglés) se transportaron fuera del emplazamiento de la obra en autobús.” “En este momento estoy mirando a cuatro coches de policía. La policía de Fargo, delante de mí, esta sobre un 1/8 de milla de distancia. Seguimos orando seguimos de pie. Estamos aquí”, dijo Joye. Melissa dijo: “Los policías hicieron una barricada, cantamos, oramos, y marchamos a la derecha más allá de ellos para cerrar el sitio de trabajo. Llegamos desde tres direcciones, cientos de nosotros. Utilizamos sus propias tácticas contra ellos. Marchamos 3 millas hasta el momento. Los empujamos hacia atrás milla tras milla. Hay personas encadenadas a la maquinaria en el lugar de la construcción. Nos dirigimos a ellos. Envíenos todo su amor. “ Las solicitudes de acceso transparente a la información, muestran que para Dakota del Norte y Morton Co., todo tiene que ver con el dinero.\n",
      "\n",
      "Los transmisores en vivo en las redes sociales, autodenominados “Unicornios antidisturbios” (Unicorn Riot) presentaron una solicitud de registros públicos. Los registros muestran que para el estado de Dakota del Norte y el condado de Morton todo tiene que ver con el dinero. Las tácticas de fuerza excesiva de la policía del estado y el uso de un exceso de vigilancia sirven para aterrorizar al público. El estado y Morton Co. son los únicos que tratan de incitar a una revuelta. Los transmisores en vivo en las redes sociales de “Unicornios antidisturbios” son algunos de los medios que han sido detenidos y encarcelados por estos agentes que violan los derechos humanos y los derechos civiles. Morton Co. no quiere que el público vea la verdad revelada en las transmisiones en vivo, por lo que la policía está deteniendo a los medios de comunicación. La verdad es que los pueblos originarios de Norteamérica se enfrentan a los vehículos blindados y armas de asalto cargadas mientras rezan. Vea los registros de Unicornio antidisturbios solicitados que revelan porque el estado de Dakota del Norte y de la policía, solo les interesa el dinero: http://www.unicornriot.ninja/? p=9638\n",

       "\"“Propaganda” y “relaciones sociales” : Guerra y Estado Policial.\\n\\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\\n\\n(Before It's News)\\n\\nEl título más apropiado debería haber sido: Técnicas de propaganda modernas utilizadas por el Estado corporativo para hacer cumplir las políticas anti-democráticas y destructivas que implican habitualmente la fabricación y manipulación de los hechos noticiosos para moldear la opinión pública y, de cómo Edward Bernays usó la “ingeniería del consentimiento” para ciertos fines, pero bueno, el elegido creo que resume esquemáticamente lo que quiero explicar.\\n\\nTales eventos incluyen no sólo las abiertas apelaciones políticas, sino también los actos de terrorismo aparentemente espontáneo y el militarismo que traumatiza el cuerpo político en última instancia y la aceptación de las narraciones falsas como las realidades políticas e históricas. Un ejemplo lo tenemos con Woodrow Wilson, que sumió a los Estados Unidos en la guerra más violenta y homicida de la historia humana. Wilson, un ex académico de la Universidad de Princeton, preparado para un cargo público por los banqueros de Wall Street, reunió a un grupo de periodistas y publicistas “progres” para que “vendiera la guerra” al pueblo estadounidense.\\n\\nGeorge Creel, Walter Lippmann, Edward Bernays y Harold Lasswell. Todos desempeñaron papeles influyentes en el recién formado Comité de Información Pública (Committee on Public Information / CPI), y pasaría a tener en sus filas figuras importantes en el pensamiento político, en las relaciones públicas y en la investigación de la guerra psicológica.\\n\\nEl CPI no sólo fue capaz de censurar oficialmente noticias e información, sino que también los fabricó. Actuando en el papel de una agencia de publicidad multifacética, la operación Creel “examinó las diferentes maneras en que la información fluía a la población e inundó estos canales con material de pro-guerra”.\\n\\nEl órgano interno del Comité se compone de 19 subdivisiones, cada uno dedicado a un tipo específico de propaganda, uno de los cuales era una división de News que distribuye más de 6.000 notas de prensa y actuó como la principal corriente de información relacionadas con la guerra. El promedio en una semana era más de 20.000 columnas periodísticas con datos proporcionados a través de la propaganda del CPI. La División de Sindicated Features contó con la ayuda de los novelistas populares, cuentistas y ensayistas. Estos principales autores estadounidenses presentaron la línea oficial en una forma fácilmente accesible alcanzando a doce millones de personas cada mes. Esfuerzos similares existieron para el cine, la oratoria improvisada en la tribuna (Four Minute Men), y la publicidad directa en el país y en el extranjero. [1]\\n\\nCon las experiencias y observaciones de estos vendedores de guerra, narradas y desarrolladas de diversas maneras a lo largo de la década de 1920 ((Lippmann, Public Opinion, The Phantom Public, Bernays, Propaganda, Crystallizing Public Opinion, Creel, How We Advertised America, Lasswell, Propaganda and the World War)), junto con la influencia de sus colegas de la élite y asociados; el optimismo de los jóvenes publicistas concerniente a la manipulación de la democracia popular por la opinión pública, tuvo su fuente con la comprensión de que la opinión pública era en realidad mucho más susceptible a la persuasión de lo que se creía previamente. Las soluciones propuestas para garantizar algo parecido a la democracia en un mundo cada vez más confuso, sentó el “objetivo” en el periodismo, guiado por la inteligencia organizada (Lippmann) y la propaganda, o lo que Edward Bernays calificó de “relaciones públicas”.\\n\\nEl argumento expuesto en “la Opinión Pública”, de Lippman fue motivado en parte por el rechazo del Senado de Estados Unidos a ser miembro de la Sociedad de Naciones. Un asesor de la administración de Wilson, una figura central detrás de la recolección de inteligencia que informó de la dinámica geopolítica de la posguerra establecidos en la Conferencia de Paz de París, y de los primeros miembros del Consejo de Relaciones Exteriores; Lippmann, considera cada vez más la democracia popular plagada por una irremediablemente mal informada opinión pública incapaz de comprender la creciente complejidad de la sociedad moderna. Sólo los expertos podrían encargarse de evaluar, comprender y actuar con el conocimiento otorgado a través de sus respectivas profesiones y campos.\\n\\nEn este sentido, el periodismo debería imitar las entonces incipientes ciencias sociales aplicando la objetividad y el aplazamiento a la experiencia de las figuras de autoridad establecidas. Noticias e información podrían ser analizadas, editadas y coordinadas de manera similar para asegurar la exactitud de los periodistas ejerciendo métodos tecnocráticos similares. Aunque Lippmann no especifica exactamente qué organismo se encargaría de supervisar este proceso de “inteligencia organizada,” sus actividades de posguerra proporciona una pista.\\n\\nLa abogacía de Edward Bernays para con la gestión de la opinión pública es mucho más práctica y manifiesta. Mientras que Lippmann sugiere una democracia regimentada a través de noticias tecnocráticas y el procesamiento de la información; Bernays subraya la manipulación abierta sobre de “cómo la población interpreta la realidad en sí” por parte de una élite privilegiada. Tal manipulación requiere asociaciones artificiales, figuras y acontecimientos que parecen auténticos y espontáneos. “Cualquier persona u organización depende en última instancia de la aprobación del público”, señala Bernays:\\n\\n“Y por lo tanto, se enfrentan con el problema de la ingeniería del consentimiento del público a un programa o meta … Rechazamos el autoritarismo o la regimentación del gobierno, pero estamos dispuestos a ser persuadidos por la palabra escrita o hablada. La ingeniería del consenso es la esencia misma del proceso democrático, la libertad de persuadir y sugerir”.“Los líderes democráticos deben desempeñar su papel en la conducción de la opinión pública a través de la ingeniería del consenso con las metas y valores socialmente constructivos. Esta función impone de forma natural sobre ellos la obligación de utilizar los procesos educativos, así como otras técnicas disponibles, para lograr lo más completa comprensión posible. – “Relaciones Públicas”, Bernays. [2]\\n\\nEscrito en la década de 1950, estas observaciones se hacen especialmente aptas en la segunda mitad del siglo XX, cuando los EE.UU. sean típicamente un agresor importante en los asuntos exteriores (y eventualmente domésticos). Sin embargo, ¿qué quiere decir Bernays por, por ejemplo, “los procesos educativos”? Una indicación puede encontrarse observando su papel central en la promoción del consumo de tabaco, la fluoración del agua municipal, y el derrocamiento del régimen de Arbenz, elegido democráticamente en Guatemala. [3]\\n\\nDe hecho, una gran cantidad de ejemplos históricos contemporáneos sugieren cómo la “ingeniería del consentimiento” ha sido totalmente calculada -y es totalmente antidemocrática. Donde las crisis que requieren este tipo de relaciones públicas drásticas e inmediatas y medidas militares, son a su vez, el resultado de las políticas y acciones del mismo liderazgo. La provocación social y económica de Estados Unidos llevó al ataque japonés a Pearl Harbor y el incidente del Golfo de Tonkin que precipitó la ocupación militar estadounidense de Vietnam son ejemplos obvios de tales eventos manufacturados.\\n\\nTécnicas similares son evidentes en los principales asesinatos políticos de la década de 1960, donde hasta hoy se le pide al público a participar en la falsa realidad de que Lee Harvey Oswald fue el único culpable en el asesinato del presidente John F. Kennedy. De hecho, en este caso concreto aparece una abrumadora evidencia que apunta a la participación de la Agencia Central de Inteligencia en la orquestación del asesinato.\\n\\nEl asesinato del gobierno estadounidense del Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., probablemente el personaje más influyente del público afroamericano del siglo XX, no es objeto de debate, a pesar de haber sido profundamente probado en un tribunal de justicia. [4] Sin embargo, como con Kennedy, es un auténtico logro de las relaciones públicas que gran parte de la población estadounidense es ajeno a las dinámicas más profundas de estos asesinatos políticos que se pasan por alto sistemáticamente o se relata en el discurso público de manera inexacta.\\n\\nEn este sentido, en el contexto histórico de la Operación Gladio, el atentado de Oklahoma City en el Edificio Federal Murrah, los acontecimientos del 11 de septiembre de 2001, los atentados del 11 de marzo en Madrid y Londres del 07/07/2005, la ingeniería del consenso ha alcanzado nuevas alturas asombrosas en que se utiliza el terrorismo orquestado por el Estado para moldear la opinión pública hacia la aceptación de las operaciones policiales militarizadas, la continua erosión de las libertades civiles y la agresión sostenida contra naciones moderadas de Oriente Medio con el fin de crear un cártel sobre los recursos (escasos) y, políticamente reconfigurar toda una región del mundo.\\n\\nUna vez más, el público es esencialmente obligado a creer que el extremismo político de una forma u otra es la causa de cada evento; incluso a la luz de cómo la sofisticación y el alcance de los “ataques” a la Ciudad de Oklahoma y NYC, sugieren el trabajo de fuerzas de alto nivel. Si uno ahonda debajo de la narrativa de las relaciones públicas de cada caso, la reciente masacre de Newtown y las bombas en la maratón de Boston parecen tener agendas similares donde el público ha sido deliberadamente engañado de nuevo. Periodistas y académicos convencionales son reticentes a abordar públicamente estos fenómenos por temor a ser llamados “teóricos de la conspiración” y a perder su estatus.\\n\\nDe hecho, el meme “teoría de la conspiración”, fue una campaña de propaganda emprendida por la CIA a mediados de la década de 1960 para contrarrestar las críticas del informe de la Comisión Warren, que es tal vez tan poco conocida como la Operación Mockingbird, el programa de la CIA, donde cientos de periodistas y editores prestaron activamente sus servicios para difundir desinformación de la Agencia. El efecto global de estas operaciones combinadas ha sido un programa de gran éxito que continúa dando forma a los contornos de la vida política y real estadounidense. [5]\\n\\nLa condición socio-política actual y la supresión de la democracia popular son triunfos de la técnica de la propaganda moderna. Así, están también de manifiesto en los esfuerzos del estado corporativo para diseñar la conformidad del público hacia cosas tales como los fraudes colosales de los organismos modificados genéticamente que se hacen pasar como “alimento”, tóxicos disfrazados de “medicina”, el estado policial y la “guerra contra el terror” en busca de preservar la “seguridad nacional”.\\n\\nNotas:\\n\\nCómo Anunciamos América , Nueva York: Harper and Brothers, 1920 Disponible en [1] Aaron Delwiche, “Propaganda: tiempo de guerra de la propaganda: la Primera Guerra Mundial, el Comité de Información Pública”, consultado en 28 de septiembre 2014 en http://www.propagandacritic.com/articles/ww1.cpi.html ; George Creel,, Nueva York: Harper and Brothers, 1920 Disponible en http://archive.org/details/howweadvertameri00creerich\\n\\n[2] Edward Bernays, Relaciones Públicas , Norman OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 1952, 159-160.\\n\\n[3] “You can get practically any ideas accepted”, Bernays , campaña para fluorar el suministro de agua de la ciudad de Nueva York. ”Si los médicos están a favor, el público está dispuesto a aceptarlo, porque un médico es una autoridad para la mayoría de la gente, sin importar lo mucho que sabe o no sabe … Por la ley de los promedios, usted puede encontrar generalmente un individuo en cualquier campo que estará dispuesto a aceptar nuevas ideas y las nuevas ideas luego se infiltrarán en los otros que no lo han aceptado.
